	* Fixed bug that if a logical drive had an active spare, and thus was
	  "ok", the exit code was still zero, so it acted as though nothing
	  were wrong, even though the failed drive needed replacing to get back
	  to original good status with spares.
	* Fixed bug in spare status messages.  One message was left out, and so
	  some of the others were wrong, being off-by-one.
	* Bumped version up to 1.06
