Just type

	./configure
	make

and, as root:

	make install

The "make install" will put cciss_vol_status into /usr/bin,
and cciss_vol_status.8.gz into /usr/share/man/man8

To uninstall, as root:

	make uninstall

This will remove /usr/share/man/man8/cciss_vol_status.8.gz
and /usr/bin/cciss_voL_status

Note, if configure complains about cciss_ioctl.h not compiling,
it is because in the kernel header, there is an attribute "__user"
which configure fails to #define out of existence.  (cciss_vol_status.c
does do this.)  You can safely ignore this warning from configure.
