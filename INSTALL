Just type

	./configure
	make

and, as root:

	make install

The "make install" will put cciss_vol_status into /usr/bin,
and cciss_vol_status.8.gz into /usr/share/man/man8

To uninstall, as root:

	make uninstall

This will remove /usr/share/man/man8/cciss_vol_status.8.gz
and /usr/bin/cciss_voL_status

Notes that may help with getting things to compile:
===================================================

Note: If configure complains about cciss_ioctl.h not compiling,
it might be because in the kernel header, there is an attribute "__user"
which configure fails to #define out of existence.  (cciss_vol_status.c
does do this.)  You can safely ignore this warning from configure, as
the cciss_vol_status code does #define __user precisely because of
this.  However, it may be the case, esp. if your distro is quite old
that cciss_ioctl.h does not compile for another reason (see below).

Note:  If "make" gives you a message such as:
WARNING: `aclocal-1.10' is needed, and you do not seem to have it handy on your
         system.  You might have modified some files without having the
         proper tools for further handling them.  Check the `README' file,
         it often tells you about the needed prerequirements for installing
         this package.  You may also peek at any GNU archive site, in case
         some other package would contain this missing `aclocal-1.10' program.

You can often get around this by doing the following:

scameron@zuul:~/test/cciss_vol_status$ aclocal
scameron@zuul:~/test/cciss_vol_status$ autoconf
scameron@zuul:~/test/cciss_vol_status$ automake
scameron@zuul:~/test/cciss_vol_status$ ./configure
...
scameron@zuul:~/test/cciss_vol_status$ make 

Or, you can try to sidestep autoconf and its ornery friends, and
use linux_alternate_makefile.mk:

	make -f linux_alternate_makefile.mk

and as root:

	make -f linux_alternate_makefile.mk install

Or, you can dig around looking for aclocal-1.10

Note:  Some old distros (e.g. debian Sarge) contain a broken
version of include/linux/cciss_ioctl.h which doesn't compile at all. 
Your best bet here is to get a newer version of cciss_ioctl.h which
doesn't have that problem.  There are recent (circa 2010) cciss header
files contained here, cciss_ioctl.h and cciss_defs.h.  You can try
using these instead of your distro's header files by doing the
following:

./configure CFLAGS=-DUSE_LOCAL_CCISS_HEADERS
make
